def with_metaclass(meta, *bases):
    # This requires a bit of explanation: the basic idea is to make a
    # dummy metaclass for one level of class instantiation that replaces
    # itself with the actual metaclass. Because of internal type checks
    # we also need to make sure that we downgrade the custom metaclass
    # for one level to something closer to type (that's why __call__ and
    # __init__ comes back from type etc.).
    #
    # This has the advantage over six.with_metaclass in that it does not
    # introduce dummy classes into the final MRO.
