Pythonic
========

Pythonic provides static Python analysis of style guide violations and
possible errors.

One of the primary goals of Pythonic is to make it configurable so that
warnings can be ignored as necessary, other tools often make this unnecessarily
difficult or only allow ignoring warnings globally.
